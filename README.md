# O-Launcher-ts

A copy of Jesse Skelton's o-launcher-script written in TypeScript for ease of use

This is meant to go in '~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications',
if it is not in that exact folder then it won't work and you'll have to change the 'rules.ts' file,
at the bottom there is a fs.writeFileSync and if you wan't to change the location of the karabiner.json, change it there.

This is fully customizable and also really easy to use because it is in TypeScript.
